# Apprenticeship Portfolio  

Hello world!  

My name is Spyridon Nasopoulos, and I live in Thessaloniki, Greece.  

By the time you're reading this, I will (probably!) have completed my studies at **IEK AKMI Thessaloniki**, specializing in **Web Development and Game Design**.  
I'm also passionate about **networking** and currently preparing for **Cisco’s CCNA exam**.  
During my studies, I focused on **Web Development**, exploring various technologies, including **C, C++, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress**.  

### What's in this repository?  

Here, you'll find:  
- Projects developed in **C and C++**  
- A **bookstore e-shop** built with **HTML, CSS, and PHP**  
- A **WordPress-based e-shop**  

I’d love for you to check out my projects and share your thoughts with me! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
